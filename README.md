# Recruiting Sign Up Form
### IS 403 Midterm Practice Problem
You work for RoseLeaf, a local tech startup doing web development. You have been tasked with recruiting at career fairs at universities and colleges in Utah and Salt Lake counties to find the best and brightest students to help the company expand. 
You have been asked to make a website that will be displayed on an iPad or laptop at your booth. After you give your spiel, students can give you their information to continue the recruiting process. 
Make an simple website using the MVC framework to gather this information for your company. 

### Brief Instructions 
1. Create a Model that creates a Student object. This object takes parameters like name, email, phone, school, major, field of interest, and any other necessary info you can think of. 
2. Create a Controller and methods to deal with receiving and gathering the data. Include a List or other data structure that holds all the Student objects. 
3. Create an Index View as a landing page, with buttons or links to “add a student” and “display all students” [NOTE: this isn’t really practical, because anyone could view all the student info, but considering the scope of the midterm…] 
4. Create another View where students enter their information (Student model) in an HTML form.
5. Create another View that thanks a student for signing up. Personalize it for the student! Include navigation back to the landing page.
6. Create another View where the students are all listed in a table with all the information they entered. Include navigation back to the landing page.
7. Make it look good. Something that will catch students’ eyes more than a boring excel sheet!
